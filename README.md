# Random Number Prediction Website
Welcome to the Random Number Prediction website! This simple website allows you to test your guessing skills by predicting a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It's a fun way to challenge yourself and see how well you can estimate whether the number will be higher or lower than your guess.

## How It Works
Guess a Number: Start by entering a number between 1 and 100 into the input field. This will be your prediction for the randomly generated number.

Generate Random Number: Click on the "Check" button to let the website check a random number between 1 and 100.

Compare and Predict: Once the random number is checked, the website will compare your prediction with the generated number. If your guess is lower than the generated number, the website will display "It's higher!" If your guess is higher than the generated number, it will display "It's lower!" Keep making predictions to see if you can narrow down your guesses and get closer to the generated number.

Winning the Game: Try to make as few guesses as possible to accurately predict the generated number. The ultimate challenge is to guess the exact number with the fewest guesses!

## Features
Random Number Generation: The website uses a random number generator to ensure fairness and unpredictability in each round.

Interactive Interface: The user-friendly interface makes it easy to input your guesses and receive immediate feedback.

Challenge Yourself: Test your intuition and number prediction skills by trying to make accurate guesses based on the "higher" or "lower" feedback.

Educational: This website can also be used as a simple educational tool to teach basic concepts of probability and number comparisons.
